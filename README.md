# Snake-Game-

The Snake game is a classic game that is enjoyed by many people over the years. It follows the same concept as the Nokia Snake game, where the player controls a snake that moves around a rectangular playing field.

The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat the food that randomly appears on the screen, avoiding hitting the walls of the playing field or the snake's own body. As the snake eats more food, it grows longer, making it more difficult to avoid obstacles.

The game features a scoring system that increases as the snake eats more food. The player's score is displayed on the screen, along with the length of the snake. The game also has a timer that keeps track of how long the player has been playing.

The Snake game utilizes various programming concepts, such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and arrays, to create an interactive and engaging gaming experience. The game's graphics are simple but effective, using ASCII characters to depict the snake, food, and obstacles.


## Snake Game in C Language

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Snake game, written in C language. The game has a fixed-size play area, and the player controls a snake that moves around the area, eating food and growing longer. The game ends when the snake either crashes into a wall or into its own body.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you'll need to compile the source code into an executable file. You can do this using any C compiler, such as GCC or Clang.

Once you've compiled the code, simply run the executable to start the game.

## Controls

The player controls the snake using the arrow keys:

Up arrow: move the snake up
Down arrow: move the snake down
Left arrow: move the snake left
Right arrow: move the snake right

## Rules
The game starts with a single snake segment at a random position on the play area. The player must move the snake around the area, eating food and growing longer with each piece of food consumed.

The game ends if the snake crashes into a wall or into its own body. The player's score is the number of pieces of food eaten.

## Implementation Details

The game is implemented using the Windows Console API for graphics and input handling. The snake and food are represented as arrays of coordinates, and their movements are controlled by manipulating these arrays.

The game loop runs continuously until the player loses, updating the game state and redrawing the screen with each iteration.
